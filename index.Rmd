## Hello, CompBio Friends!

My name is Claire and I am a **1st year PhD Student** in ALE studying Plant and Soil Science. I moved here in August from Wisconsin where I got my MS in Agroecology at UW-Madison. I absolutely loved Madison, but the Midwest lacks mountains and ocean... being from Boston I require both in my life. 

I primarily work up in St. Albans at the UVM-Extension office but will be on campus for class. I live in the Old North End so I am a fan of the short commute to campus compared to driving 35 minutes up to St. Albans. 

When I am not working or in class I try to stay active skiing, running, lifting, playing basketball. If anyone is looking for a workout buddy let me know... need accountabili-buddies.
